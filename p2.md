| -------------------------------------- | ---- |
| i've had a cold since my arrival       |      |
| we live in the same alley              |      |
| descale, gut, and clean the fish       |      |
| we had to think what to do next        |      |
| doctors advised me to have it removed  |      |
| she's changing to go out               |      |
| their house was buried by a landslide  |      |
| will you oblige me with a stamp        |      |
| fine feathers do not make find birds   |      |
| you spoke too soon                     |      |
| he jokes amused the whole table        |      |
| he drove a good bargain on last sunday |      |
| you have to learn to face your problem |      |
| he worked in carpenter's shop          |      |
| she is fond of geometry                |      |
| salter shouted with joy                |      |
| the way ahead is tortuous              |      |
| she came tripping down the garden path |      |
| the swimming pool is five meters wide  |      |
| each period lasts fourty minutes       |      |
| i regret what i've done to her         |      |
| sharpe felt an emptiness inside        |      |
| her father was a polish count          |      |
| her dress was a vivid color            |      |
| he spoke very clearly indeed           |      |
| he gave me a second shot of peniciline |      |
| i requested a taxi for eight o'clock   |      |
| the smell of powder was in the air     |      |
| he has great skill in painting         |      |
| he scraped through the narrow opening  |      |
| there was too much chat in the office  |      |
| crime is on the increase               |      |
| you can give me a full report later    |      |
| place the card face down on the table  |      |
| i go there very little now             |      |
| they ran short of gasoline             |      |
| would you like a cup of tea            |      |
| then her brow cleared                  |      |
| she received a text message from him   |      |
| one color may kill another near it     |      |
| would you like a sit on the deck-chair |      |
| we should not rat on our promises      |      |
| social divisions in the city are stark |      |
| someboy stuck a knife in him           |      |
| they play cards every friday           |      |
| he painted the wall with a brush       |      |
| i'm sorry i am not with you            |      |
| can you tell me the way to the station |      |
| we were glad to about her success      |      |
| she painted the door green             |      |
