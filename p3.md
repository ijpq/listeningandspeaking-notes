| i love animals                                               |      |
| when he wake up, the sun was rising.                         |      |
| why don't you sit down and communicate with your brother     |      |
| what can i do                                                |      |
| with no light outside, it felt like midnight                 |      |
| most people would never think about this                     |      |
| the weather is beautiful today                               |      |
| at home, i alway feel lonely and nervous                     |      |
| so what were people doing yesterday at the time of the rainstorm |      |
| relation between my parents have become difficult            |      |
| everyone in the neighborhood was busy                        |      |
| it is not enough to just get good grades at school           |      |
| my problem is that i can't get on with my family             |      |
| he always refuse to let me watch my favourite tv show        |      |
| thank you again for changing my life                         |      |
| children these day depand on their parents too much          |      |
| why don't you talk about these feelings with your family     |      |
| is that normal                                               |      |
| this storm brought people closer together                    |      |
| i was excited about the idea of having a dog                 |      |
| he had no idea how to take care of himself                   |      |
| let me tell my story                                         |      |
| could you get this for me                                    |      |
| he often feel ill                                            |      |
| it also helps them to understand the idea of fairness        |      |
| i don't know if i should say anything to them about this     |      |
| but many people have this difficulties                       |      |
| black clouds were making the sky very dark                   |      |
| i don't think this is fair                                   |      |
| i think it is important for children to learn how to do chores |      |
| they join the neighbors to help clean up the neighborhood together |      |
| after dinner they try to play a card game                    |      |
| i hope things will be better for you soon                    |      |
| be could not sleep at first                                  |      |
